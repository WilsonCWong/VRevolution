                    Virtual reality (VR) is the future. Whether it'd be getting a tour of a building yet to be built
                    or playing games with never seen before immersion, this technology provides many
                    new opportunities that has yet to be explored. While VR is still in its infancy, it
                    is a fast-growing industry that developers can capitalize on right now. This is an industry that has
                    a lot of room for innovation, and as such, many opportunities for developers to make a name for themselves.
                    Rather than adding another app to the app store, developers may want to start thinking about the potential
                    of developing the VR headsets because it is still quite an untapped market.

                    Currently, many popular tools across many industries are implementing support for VR
                    functionality. Game engines like Unity are working on tools that make it easy to create
                    VR games. Even video tools like Adobe Premiere are adding support for VR videos. There is no doubt
                    that the VR industry will only continue to grow as VR headsets become mainstream and affordable for
                    everyday consumers.

            <h2>Options</h2>
            <p>
                There are many options when it comes to VR headsets. While cheap options
                such as Google Cardboard or Samsung Gear exist, they do not provide the best
                VR experience. For full immersion, you will either need to go with the Oculus Rift
                or the HTC Vive. These two headsets are top of the line, though the Vive has enjoyed
                more popularity due to its motion controls.

                        roleplay as in the game via Unity's SDK. The app is like living a second life, interacting
                        with people close up across the world.
